         <li>½ (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Gravy Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
         <li>2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
         <li>1 sweet onion, sliced</li>
         <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
         <li>½ (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
         <li>1 ½ cups beef stock</li>
         <li>1 cup water</li>
         <li>Salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
         <li>
            Make the patties: Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk,
            1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper
            together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.
         </li>
         <li>
            Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet
            until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
         </li>
         <li>
            Make the gravy: Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high
            heat. Sauté mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about
            5 minutes. Stir flour and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into
            mushroom mixture until combined.
         </li>
         <li>
            Gradually add beef stock and water, stirring continually, until
            simmering. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring frequently, until
            gravy has thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and
            pepper.
         </li>
         <li>
            Place browned patties into gravy; simmer until very tender, about 30
            minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
            read 160°F (70°C).
         </li>
      </ol>
